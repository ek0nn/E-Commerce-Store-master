   <h1 className='titlewhy'>Keyboard Sizes</h1>
   <p className='whytext'>There are several different sizes of keyboards available, each with its own unique set of features.</p>

   <h3 class='ptitle222'>Full-sized keyboard</h3>
    <p class='ptitle2222'> The most common keyboard size is the full-size keyboard, which typically includes a number pad and function keys. This keyboard is great for those who require a lot of keys for typing or work purposes, but it may not be ideal for those with limited desk space.</p>
    <h3 class='ptitle222'>Tenkeyless (TKL)</h3>
    <p class='ptitle2222'> Another popular option is the tenkeyless (TKL) keyboard, which is similar to a full-size keyboard but without the number pad. This design saves space on your desk and can be more comfortable for some users.</p>
    <h3 class='ptitle222'>60% Keyboard (TKL)</h3>
    <p class='ptitle2222'>For even more compactness, there are 60% keyboards, which omit the arrow keys and some other keys to save even more space. These keyboards are popular with gamers and those who want a more minimalist design.
 </p>
 <h3 class='ptitle222'>Other Keyboards (TKL)</h3>
 <p class='ptitle2222'>Other keyboard sizes include 75%, 65%, and 40%, which all offer different combinations of keys and features. Ultimately, the size of your keyboard depends on your personal preferences, the tasks you'll be performing, and the amount of desk space you have available. </p>

   <h1 className='titlewhy'>Step 2 - PCB</h1>
   <h3 className='ptitle222'> Testing the PCB </h3>
   <p class='ptitle22222'> To test if your keyboard PCB is working correctly, you'll need a pair of tweezers and a computer with a USB cable. First, plug in your PCB to the computer using the USB cable. Then, go to a Keyboard Tester website to check the connections.

Using the tweezers, gently touch the two small holes where each key should be placed. Make sure not to push too hard, as this can cause damage. If everything is working properly, the symbol on the Keyboard Tester website should change color even if you press the keys lightly. You should test each key to ensure that they all work properly. </p>

   <h1 className='titlewhy'>Step 3 - Stabilisers</h1>
   <h3 className='ptitle222'> Assemble the Stabilizers </h3>
   <p class='ptitle22222'> When building a custom keyboard, it's common to disassemble the stabilizers to ensure they are working properly. To put the stabilizers back together before installation, you'll need to assemble the housing, stem, and wire. Each stabilizer will have two stems, two housings, and one wire. The best way to assemble them is to insert the stem into the housing through its bottom. The side with two holes should face the front side of the housing, which is the larger side. The tiny guides on the housing should be holding the wire. <br/><br/> The wire should go through the housing to the bottom hole, but make sure it goes all the way down the stem. Once you insert it, press the wire into the guide until you hear a clicking sound, which means it has snapped into place in the housing. This ensures the stabilizer is properly assembled and ready to be installed into your custom keyboard.

   <h1 className='titlewhy'>Step 4 - Stabilisers</h1>
   <h3 className='ptitle222'> Mount the Stabilisers </h3>
   <p class='ptitle22222'> Moving on to the next step in our custom keyboard guide, let's learn how to mount the stabilizers. On your PCB, you'll notice two circles around the edges where the larger keys should be placed. The larger hole is used for the clip, while the smaller one is for the threaded portion of the stabilizer if you're using screw-in stabilizers.<br/><br/> However, if you're using snap-in stabilizers, the larger holes will be on the side where the wire is located. It's important to pay attention to these details to ensure you mount the stabilizers correctly and securely on your PCB, which will ultimately result in a stable and functional custom keyboard.</p>

   <h1 className='titlewhy'>Step 5 -  Mounting the Plate on the PCB</h1>
   <h3 className='ptitle222'> Testing the PCB </h3>
   <p class='ptitle22222'>Let's move on to the next step in building your custom keyboard, which is mounting the plate on the PCB. This step is crucial as it ensures that your switches are aligned correctly, and your keyboard functions smoothly. By securing the plate to the PCB, you'll be able to minimize any wobbling or misalignment that may occur during use.<br/><br/>To mount the plate, first, align the plate's screw holes with the screw holes on the PCB. Once aligned, insert the screws into the holes and gently tighten them with a screwdriver, being careful not to over-tighten them. It's important to ensure that the plate is flush against the PCB to prevent any unwanted movement.<br/><br/> Once you've successfully mounted the plate on the PCB, you can move on to the next step in building your custom keyboard, which is inserting the switches.</p>

   <h1 className='titlewhy'>Step 6 - Switches</h1>
   <h3 className='ptitle222'> Install the switches </h3>
   <p class='ptitle22222'> After you have mounted the plate and stabilizers, the next step is to install the switches on the plate. <br /><br /> First, ensure that the plate is oriented correctly with the PCB, and all the switch holes line up with the corresponding solder pads on the PCB.<br /><br />Next, place the switches in the holes on the plate. You should be able to feel a slight snap as the switch clicks into place. Make sure the switches are seated properly and securely on the plate.<br /><br /> After all the switches are installed, it's a good idea to test them for functionality. Use a keycap puller or your fingers to press down on each switch, making sure that it registers on the PCB. You can also use a multimeter to check for continuity between the switch pins and the corresponding solder pads on the PCB.<br /><br />Once you have confirmed that all the switches are functioning properly, you can proceed to soldering them onto the PCB. Make sure to follow the correct soldering technique and avoid overheating the switch or PCB.<br /><br /> After soldering the switches, you can test them again to make sure they still work correctly. Once everything is confirmed to be working, you can proceed to adding keycaps and configuring your keyboard settings to your liking.</p>

   <h1 className='titlewhy'>Step 7 - Case</h1>
   <h3 className='ptitle222'> Preparing the Gaskets and the Case </h3>
   <p class='ptitle22222'> Preparing the gaskets and case is an important step in building a custom keyboard. The gaskets help to dampen sound and create a tighter seal between the plate, PCB, and case.<br /><br/>First, inspect the gaskets to make sure they are clean and free from any debris. Then, apply a small amount of lubricant to the gaskets to ensure a smooth and secure fit.<br /><br/>Next, prepare the case by removing any protective film or packaging. If your case has any screws or standoffs, make sure they are installed and tightened securely.

Place the gaskets around the perimeter of the case, ensuring they are properly aligned and fit snugly against the case edges. Make sure to leave the mounting points clear so that the plate can be screwed onto the case later.<br /><br/>Once the gaskets are in place, carefully place the plate onto the gaskets, ensuring it is properly aligned with the PCB and gaskets. If your keyboard build includes a top gasket, make sure to place it on top of the plate before securing the case.<br /><br/> Finally, carefully screw the case onto the plate, making sure not to overtighten the screws. It's important to ensure that the plate, PCB, and case are all tightly secured together to prevent any unwanted movement or rattling.<br /><br/> With the gaskets and case prepared, you can now proceed to install the keycaps and any additional components, such as LEDs or sound dampening foam, before testing and using your custom keyboard.</p>

   <h1 className='titlewhy'>Step 8 - Reassembling the Case </h1>
   <h3 className='ptitle222'>  Reassembling the Case </h3>
   <p class='ptitle22222'> After completing the previous steps of building your custom keyboard, it's time to put everything back together. This involves screwing both halves of the keyboard together.<br /><br />

To do this, simply align the top and bottom halves of the case and insert the screws into the designated holes. Use a screwdriver to tighten each screw until they are snug, but be careful not to over-tighten as this can damage the case or the keyboard components.<br /><br />

Once all the screws are in place, give the keyboard a gentle shake to ensure that everything is securely fastened together. If everything looks good, you're ready to plug in your keyboard and start typing away on your custom-built masterpiece!<br /><br /> </p>

  <div className='container-xxl bgcol2'>
   <h1 className='titlewhy'>Step 9 - Keycaps</h1>
   <h3 className='ptitle222'> Installing the Keycaps  </h3>
   <p class='ptitle22222'>This step is fairly straightforward, but it can be a bit time-consuming, especially if you have a lot of keys to install.<br /><br />

To start, find the keycap that corresponds to each switch on your keyboard. The shape of the keycap and the letter or symbol on it should match the switch underneath.<br /><br />

Next, simply place the keycap onto the switch and press down firmly until you feel it snap into place. You may need to wiggle the keycap a bit to get it to align properly with the switch.<br /><br />

Repeat this process for each keycap until all of them are installed on the switches. Be sure to double-check that each key is seated correctly and securely.<br /><br />

Once all the keycaps are in place, you're done! Your custom keyboard is now complete and ready to use. Enjoy typing away on your unique and personalized keyboard!<br /><br /> </p>
